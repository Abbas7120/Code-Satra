# Challenges & Lessons 🎯

### Day 1️⃣
- 💡 Concept
  - Introduction to arrays
  - Why to use arrays?
  - Sorting algos:
    - Bubble sort
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
- ❓ Question
  - Given an array of integers, write a function that sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm and count the number of swaps performed during the sorting process. The function should return the sorted array and the total number of swaps.

### Day 2️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Advanced sorting algorithms:
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
- ❓ Question
  - Given an array nums of length n+m where first n elements are sorted. Your task is to sort the last m elements in-place so that the whole array becomes sorted.

### Day 3️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Searching algorithms:
    - Linear search
    - Binary search
- ❓ Question
  - To make one bouquet we need K adjacent flowers from the garden. Here the garden consists of N different flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i]. Each flower can be used inside only one bouquets. We have to find the minimum number of days need to wait to make M bouquets from the garden. If we cannot make M bouquets, then < return -1. Input: M = 2, K = 3 bloomDay = [5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5], Output: 10
