I am excited to finish this challenge 💪. Wish me well 😉!

# Challenges & Lessons 🎯

### Day 1️⃣
- 💡 Concept
  - Introduction to arrays
  - Why to use arrays?
  - Sorting algos:
    - Bubble sort
    - Selection sort
    - Insertion sort
- ❓ Question
  - Given an array of integers, write a function that sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm and count the number of swaps performed during the sorting process. The function should return the sorted array and the total number of swaps.

### Day 2️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Advanced sorting algorithms:
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort
- ❓ Question
  - Given an array nums of length n+m where first n elements are sorted. Your task is to sort the last m elements in-place so that the whole array becomes sorted.

### Day 3️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Searching algorithms:
    - Linear search
    - Binary search
- ❓ Question
  - To make one bouquet we need K adjacent flowers from the garden. Here the garden consists of N different flowers, the ith flower will bloom in the bloomDay[i]. Each flower can be used inside only one bouquets. We have to find the minimum number of days need to wait to make M bouquets from the garden. If we cannot make M bouquets, then < return -1. Input: M = 2, K = 3 bloomDay = [5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 5, 5], Output: 10

### Day 4️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Greedy Algorithms:
    - Activity Selection Problem
    - Fractional Knapsack Problem
    - Huffman Coding
- ❓ Question
  - You are an owner of lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one at a time (in the order specified by given array bills[]). Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction is Chat the customer pays $5. NOTE: At first, you do not have any bill to provide changes with. You can provide changes from the bills that you get from the previous customers. Given an integer array bills of size N where bills [i] is the bill the ith customer pays, return true if you can provide every customer with the correct change, or false otherwise. Input: N = 5, bills [] = {5, 5, 5, 10, 20) Output: True

### Day 5️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Divide and Conquer:
    - Divide
    - Conquer
    - Combine
  - Key concepts:
    - Merge sort
    - Median finding
    - Min and max finding
- ❓ Question
  - Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kth position of the final sorted array. Input arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}, arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}, k = 5. Output: 6.

### Day 6️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Linked List:
    - Structure
    - Advantages
    - Types
      - Single
      - Double
      - Circular
- ❓ Question
  - Given a sorted linked list, write a function that removes all duplicates such that each element only appears once. Input: LinkedList = 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5. Output: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5.

### Day 7️⃣
- 💡 Concept:
  - Stacks:
    - Key operations: push, pop, peek/top, is_empty
    - Use case: function call management, undo mechanism in text editors, syntax parsing
  - Queues:
    - Key operations: enqueue, dequeue, front/peek, is_empty
    - Use case: task scheduling, handling request in web server, BFS in graphs
- ❓ Question
  - Determine if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Use both a stack and a queue to check for palindromes. Input: CodeSatra. Output: False
